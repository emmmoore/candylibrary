# Folder Project

### Objective: 
We usually encounter a lot of unncessary troubles when dealing with folders with a lot of subfolders in our lives, so this Java project saves users time and effort when dealing with files in folders. 

### Functions: 

1. Drag out all of the files with the same ending (ex. ".txt", ".java") from a folder (including from the subfolders within the folder) and place them in the location the user wants

2. Generate reports of the original folder and the modified folder for users to check if there is any error in the process of moving files around. 

##### Functions to Develop 

3. When there are two files with the same name in the folder, rename them with different suffixes to distinguish them. 

4. Generalize the [Dropfolder](https://github.com/yxie21/library/blob/master/DropFolder.java) to make it
    a. able to be executed in folders with more than two layers of subfolders
    b. compatible on all devices (Mac, Windows, Linux)
